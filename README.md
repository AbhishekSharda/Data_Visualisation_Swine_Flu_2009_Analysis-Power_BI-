**Analysis of the Swine Flu Outbreak of 2009: A Story of How I Uncovered the Factors that Contributed to the Outbreak** 
As I delved into my research on the swine flu outbreak of 2009, I began by looking at the big picture. At a macro level, North America had the highest number of cases and deaths, followed by Europe and South America. However, I was more interested in the countries that were most affected by the outbreak and wanted to find out what led to such rapid spread of the disease.
I drilled down to the country level and found that Mexico had the highest number of deaths, followed by the United States. I was curious to know what caused the rapid spread of the disease in these two countries, and that's when I thought of looking at the population density per square mile for both countries.
To my surprise, the states with higher population densities had the greatest number of cases. For instance, I found out that New Jersey, which had the highest population density of 955.5 in 2010, had 21,000 cases, while Nevada, which had a population density of only 24.8 had fewer cases, 3025
. This trend was also observed in Mexico, suggesting that population density played a significant role in the spread of the outbreak.
I was also curious to know which age group was most affected in both countries. My analysis revealed that people aged 18-49 were the most affected, while the age group 0-4 was the least affected. This was an interesting finding, and I wondered if there was a correlation between age and the severity of the disease.
To further investigate the factors that contributed to the outbreak, I decided to look at pork consumption trends in the countries that were hit hardest by the swine flu outbreak. I found out that in the United States and Mexico, there was a drop in pork consumption from 2009 to 2010. This drop in consumption could be related to the swine flu outbreak and people's fears of contracting the virus through pork consumption.
In conclusion, my analysis suggests that population density played a significant role in the spread of the swine flu outbreak in the United States and Mexico. Additionally, people aged 18-49 were the most affected age group. Furthermore, the drop in pork consumption in the United States and Mexico could be related to the outbreak. I was able to uncover these factors through my analysis, and I believe that they provide valuable insights into the factors that contributed to the spread of the swine flu outbreak.
